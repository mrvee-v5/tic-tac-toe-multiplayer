# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## GAME INSTRUCTIONS##

## in other to play the tic tac toe multiplayer##

## you have to open two seperate device/browser connecting to the same host name or address e.g REACT_APP_BASE_URL = https://baaa90603145.ngrok.io or LOCALHOST = http://127.0.0.1:3000

## Start the server on this host === http://127.0.0.1:6000 which is your localhost

## please use NGROK if you are having issue with cors //

## by connecting to the device , you will get a message telling you if its your turn to play or not.

## API

## socket.io-client together with nodejs server for realtime update.

## AREAS OF GAME IMPROVEMENTS.##

## 1, an interface for creating players before hand so users can choose who to play with

## 2, create levels of game

## 3, play with different people when one is defeated

## 4, play with IA ( COMPUTER) etc...

## 5, user can also choose the kind of game to want play either with individual, group(turnament), computer(AI) etc ...

## ONE WAY TO CHEAT##

## 1, one way one can cheat on the game is by playing continousely without waiting for his opponent to play

## but that has been taken care of in this current development.

## CONCLUSION

## the script is very is easy to read and modify, jump right in and improve this game more
